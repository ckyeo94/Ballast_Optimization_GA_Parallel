# Ballast Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This project is a tool for optimizing the placement of ballast in a marine vessel or floating structure. It utilizes a parallel genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal distribution of ballast weights to achieve specific mass property targets, such as the center of gravity (CG) and moments of inertia (MOI).

## File Descriptions

-   `Ballast_Optimization_GA_Parallel_V2.py`: The main Python script that runs the genetic algorithm. It is designed to be executed from the command line and uses multiprocessing to accelerate the optimization process.
-   `config.ini`: The configuration file for the optimization script. It allows users to specify input/output file paths, ballast properties, and genetic algorithm parameters.
-   `Mass_Properties.csv`: An input CSV file that contains the vessel's initial mass properties and the target values that the optimization aims to achieve.
-   `ballast_coordinates.csv`: An input CSV file that defines all possible locations where ballast can be placed.
-   `optimized_ballast_placements.csv`: An output CSV file generated by the script, containing the final coordinates of each placed ballast.
-   `ballast_placement_3d.png`: An output 3D plot that visually represents the final placement of the ballasts within the available locations.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   `pandas` library
--   `matplotlib` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Script

To run the optimization, execute the script from your terminal:

```bash
python Ballast_Optimization_GA_Parallel_V2.py
```

The script will read the settings from `config.ini`, run the genetic algorithm, and save the results to the specified output files.

## Configuration (`config.ini`)

The `config.ini` file is divided into several sections:

-   **[FILES]**: Specifies the paths for input and output files.
-   **[BALLAST]**: Defines the physical properties of a single ballast block (mass and dimensions).
-   **[OPTIMIZATION]**: Controls the parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as population size, number of generations, and mutation rate.
-   **[WEIGHTS]**: Sets the weights for each mass property in the fitness function, allowing you to prioritize certain targets over others.
-   **[VISUALIZATION]**: A flag to enable or disable the generation of the 3D plot.

## Output

The script generates two main output files:

1.  **`optimized_ballast_placements.csv`**: A CSV file listing the `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates for each ballast placed by the algorithm.
2.  **`ballast_placement_3d.png`**: A 3D scatter plot showing the optimized ballast locations (in blue) against all available locations (in gray). This provides a quick visual verification of the result.
